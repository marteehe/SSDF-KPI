# This workflow is an extension of RV.2.1.yml and an attempt to run multiple jobs simultaneously to achieve vulnerability scanning using Snyk on all modules within a single workflow.
# Further work involves testing this to ensure it functions as intended, as it has currently reached its limit for Snyk tests this month.
